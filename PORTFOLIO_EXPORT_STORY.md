# Career Story

## 2009-2011: Full-Stack Foundations at KL82 (Creative Laboratory 82)
I began my career in 2009 at KL82, a boutique digital studio in Minsk, where I worked as a full-stack engineer delivering commercial web products end-to-end. Over two years, I shipped 20+ e-commerce websites, owning frontend interfaces, PHP/MySQL backends, server configuration, and deployment.

Although the technology stack was foundational - PHP, MySQL, JavaScript, HTML, CSS2, Apache - the work required solving real engineering problems: implementing custom designs without modern CSS tooling, building reusable UI components, and supporting highly interactive marketing experiences. I also integrated and extended platforms such as WordPress, Joomla, and Drupal, and built interactive Flash applications using ActionScript for campaign-driven projects.

To reduce delivery friction, I helped evolve and maintain an internal CMS used across client projects, extending its functionality and adapting it to diverse business needs. These years established my habit of treating systems holistically - from interface to infrastructure - and building software that was both fast to ship and maintainable over time.

## 2011-2013: Scalable Frontend Systems at Sophia Learning (via Warecorp)
In 2011, I joined Warecorp to work on Sophia Learning, an education platform based in Minneapolis with engineering and product teams in Minsk. As part of a ~25-person cross-functional team, I contributed to building an online learning system enabling students to earn transferable college-level credits.

Within a small frontend group, I focused on architecting modular, interactive JavaScript interfaces layered on top of a Ruby on Rails backend. At a time when responsive design was still emerging, we made it a foundational standard. Accessibility was treated with equal rigor - the platform underwent formal audits and achieved ADA compliance certification, shaping my long-term approach to inclusive, standards-driven UI development.

This role marked a significant step forward in managing frontend complexity at scale - structuring large jQuery-based codebases, collaborating deeply with backend and product teams, and delivering high-traffic interfaces with performance, accessibility, and usability as first-class concerns.

## 2013-2015: Frontend Ownership & Platform Evolution at Candena
In 2013, I joined Candena, a Berlin-based B2B EdTech company delivering online training platforms for enterprises and universities, including organizations such as T-Mobile and German academic institutions.

Working remotely as the sole frontend engineer within a lean engineering team, I was responsible for architecting a fully customizable, themeable platform that supported diverse branding and configuration requirements across clients. The system enabled complex, multi-stage learning programs with mentors, assignments, and team-based evaluation over extended timelines. I also led the frontend modernization strategy, defining migration phases and engineering priorities while continuing to deliver features in the legacy system.

With limited resources and no dedicated design function, I led many interface and UX decisions - defining layout systems, UI behaviors, and configuration layers to support reuse without sacrificing flexibility. I introduced structural conventions such as BEM and emphasized modularity to keep the platform adaptable as customer requirements evolved.

As the company grew and React adoption increased, I transitioned into a formal technical leadership role - leading the migration from a multi-page Rails application to a React-based single-page architecture. I set frontend direction, established coding standards, mentored incoming engineers, and documented the new system to ensure long-term maintainability. As the team expanded, I helped hire and onboard frontend engineers, introduced CI pipelines, and established delivery workflows to support a distributed team.

This experience strengthened my skills in technical leadership, product-driven architecture, and system modernization - designing for long-term scalability while shipping continuous improvements in parallel.

## 2015-2017: U.S. Transition & Freelance Exploration
In 2015, I relocated to the United States and took a deliberate pause from full-time roles to focus on English fluency, cultural adaptation, and professional recalibration.

During this period, I worked as a freelancer with early-stage startups, primarily using Angular and Vue, helping teams ship MVPs under tight constraints. These short-cycle engagements strengthened my ability to translate ambiguous product needs into pragmatic technical solutions and refine delivery strategies - skills that later became central to my leadership approach.

## 2017-2018: Conversational AI Interfaces at Amelia (IPsoft)
In 2017, I joined IPsoft (later rebranded as Amelia) to work on enterprise conversational AI products. As part of the frontend/UI engineering group, I built React-based interfaces for configuring complex dialog flows used by non-technical users.

Although the UI itself was not graphically heavy, the underlying data model was highly complex - requiring close collaboration with Cognitive Engineers who designed conversation logic using BPMN-like systems. I developed embeddable, accessible interfaces with full keyboard and assistive-technology support, deployed across browsers, mobile devices, and touch-based installations.

Beyond core product development, I supported customization, branding, and deployment for enterprise clients - helping Amelia evolve from a niche conversational UI into a highly configurable AI platform adopted by 20+ large organizations. This role marked a key transition in my career, moving from advanced frontend engineering into AI-driven product development at enterprise scale.

## 2018-2020: Design Systems & Full-Stack Delivery at Namely
In 2018, I joined Namely, a fast-growing HR and payroll platform, initially as a Senior Frontend Engineer. I was embedded in a newly formed Integration team building a greenfield product focused on employee data imports, where I led frontend planning, implementation, and release coordination.

Although engineers were distributed across multiple product teams, frontend development operated as a centralized discipline, aligned on shared architecture and tooling. As part of this group, I contributed to evolving the internal design system, supporting adoption across teams and improving UI consistency at scale.

After one year, I transitioned into a full-stack role, contributing to Go-based APIs while continuing to mentor engineers, improve frontend tooling, and guide delivery workflows. Later, I supported the Benefits team - a domain requiring interfaces capable of transforming and validating large, multi-source datasets. This period significantly broadened my backend exposure while reinforcing my ability to scale systems and collaboration in high-velocity environments.

## 2020-2024: Product & Platform Architecture at WeTransfer
I joined WeTransfer in 2020, spending four years there as both a Senior Full-Stack Engineer and later a Staff Frontend Engineer, contributing to products used by 1M+ daily users.

I began on the Paste team, building a visually rich, real-time collaborative product for creating and sharing presentations. I owned feature development end-to-end - from design review to implementation - with particular focus on animation quality, interaction smoothness, and frontend performance. I also led efforts to modernize legacy React code, defining frontend principles and introducing a progressive refactoring strategy to improve maintainability at scale.

In 2022, I became the founding frontend engineer on the App Platform team, created to unify frontend architecture across five distinct products. Partnering with engineering management, backend architecture, and product leadership, I led the design and implementation of a multi-package design system (@wetransfer-ux), spanning tokens, utilities, components, and shared modules. The system was adopted across high-traffic applications and contributed to a ~30% improvement in delivery speed by reducing duplication and standardizing practices.

I authored internal documentation, defined contribution workflows, supported hiring and interviews, and helped scale the team from 4 to 10 engineers within six months. In late 2024, WeTransfer was acquired by Bending Spoons, and the U.S. team was laid off as part of the transition.

## 2025-Present: Principal Engineering & Product Architecture at Aparti
In 2025, I joined Aparti as a Principal Engineer, working in a small, early-stage team to shape system architecture, product direction, and delivery across core workflows. In a lean environment, I take responsibility for defining technical strategy, product direction and UX decisions, and execution plans in close collaboration with founders and domain experts.

My work focuses on architectural decision-making across frontend and backend systems, designing scalable foundations for authentication, permissions, file-centric workflows, and AI-assisted product features. I translate complex domain requirements into clear technical plans and delivery milestones, balancing speed with long-term maintainability.

While my primary focus is on architecture, planning, and technical leadership, I remain hands-on on critical paths - contributing to implementation, reviewing code, and guiding execution to ensure alignment between product intent and system design. This role continues my Staff+/Principal trajectory, centered on high-leverage technical ownership and long-term system stewardship as an individual contributor.
