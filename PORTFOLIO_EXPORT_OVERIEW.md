## Overview Narrative
I'm a Staff / Principal-level frontend and full-stack engineer with 15+ years of experience building and scaling web products across startups and large consumer platforms.

My core strength is technical leadership as an individual contributor - designing frontend platforms, shared systems, and scalable architectures while staying deeply hands-on in implementation. I work at the intersection of product, architecture, and execution, often owning complex technical problems end-to-end and partnering closely with product and design to shape solutions early.

I've led frontend platform initiatives, design systems, and cross-product architecture used by millions of users, while remaining actively involved in code, reviews, and system design.

## Qualifications
- Frontend expert specializing in scalable platforms, shared UI systems, and design systems
- Technical leadership across architecture, delivery, and long-term system evolution
- Hands-on full-stack engineer (frontend-first, with active backend contributions)
- Experience leading modernization efforts across complex, legacy codebases
- Growing focus on technical management while remaining close to the code
